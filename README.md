Postman Collection Automation with Newman and Python
This project provides a robust, automated framework for running API test cases from a Postman collection and environment. It is designed to ensure the reliability and functionality of API endpoints for the Restful-Booker application.

By using Newman, the command-line collection runner for Postman, this automation seamlessly integrates Postman's powerful testing capabilities into a continuous integration or nightly build workflow.

üìö Project Overview
The core of this project is a Python script that acts as an orchestration layer. It performs the following key functions:

Executes the collection.json file using the environment.json variables.

Runs all included test cases for a variety of scenarios.

Generates a JSON-formatted test report.

Provides a human-readable summary of the test results directly in the terminal, including a clear list of any failed tests.

üß™ Test Case Coverage
The Postman collection includes a comprehensive set of test cases designed to validate the following API functionalities for the https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com base URL:

Token Generation (/auth): Validates that authentication requests correctly generate a unique authorization token.

Booking Creation (/booking): Tests the successful creation of new bookings with valid data and verifies that the response contains the expected booking details.

Booking Deletion (/booking/:id): Ensures that bookings can be successfully deleted using their unique IDs and a valid token.

Data Validation: Includes tests for various response codes, data types, and required fields across all endpoints.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
This project requires Node.js and Python to be installed on your system.

Clone the Repository:

git clone git@github.com:your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

Install Newman:
Newman is the command-line tool that runs the Postman collection.

npm install -g newman

Update Postman Files:
Place your collection.json and environment.json files in the root of the project directory.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Tests
To run the full suite of API tests, simply execute the main Python script from your terminal:

python run_tests_final.py

The script will automatically execute the Newman command, and you will see a detailed summary of the test results in your terminal. A full JSON report will also be saved as newman_report.json.

### Step 3: Add the `README.md` to Your Repository

Now that you have the content for your `README.md`, you just need to add it to your local project and push it to GitHub.

1.  **Create the file:** Copy the content above and save it in a new file named `README.md` in your project's root directory.
2.  **Add and commit the file:**
    ```bash
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "Add project README"
    ```
3.  **Push your changes:**
    ```bash
    git push origin main
